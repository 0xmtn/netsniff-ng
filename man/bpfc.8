.SH NAME
bpfc \- a Berkeley Packet Filter assembler/compiler

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB bpfc\fR { [\fIoptions\fR] | [\fIsource-file\fR] }

.SH DESCRIPTION

bpfc is a small Berkeley Packet Filter assembler/compiler which is able to
translate BPF assembler-like mnemonics into a numerical or C-like format,
that can be read by tools such as netsniff-ng, iptables (xt_bpf) and many
others. BPF is the one and only upstream filtering construct that is used
in combination with packet(7) sockets. The Linux kernel and also BSD kernels
implement ``virtual machine'' like constructs and JIT compilers that mimic
a small register-based machine in BPF architecture and execute filter code
that is e.g. composed by bpfc on a data buffer that is given by network
packets. The purpose of this is to shift computation in time, so that the
kernel can drop (or truncate) incoming packets as early as possible without
having to push them to user space for further analysis first. Meanwhile,
BPF constructs also find application in other areas like the communication
between user and kernel space.

By the time of writing this man page, the only available BPF compiler is
part of the pcap(3) library and accessible through a high-level filter
language that might be familiar for many people as tcpdump-like filters.

However, quite often, it is useful to bypass that compiler and write
optimized code that couldn't be produced by the pcap(3) compiler, was
wrongly optimized, or is defective on purpose in order to debug test kernel
code. Also, a reason to use bpfc could be to try out some new BPF extensions
that are not supported by other compilers. Furthermore, bpfc can be of good
use to verify JIT compiler behaviour or to find possible bugs that need
to be fixed.

bpfc is implemented with the help of flex(1) and bison(1), tokenizes the
source file in a first stage and parses it's content into an AST. In two
code generation stages it emits target opcodes. bpfc furthermore supports
Linux kernel BPF extensions. More about that can be found in the syntax
section.

The Linux kernel BPF JIT compiler is automatically turned on if detected
by netsniff-ng. However, it can also be manually turned on through the
command ``echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable'' (normal working
mode) or ``echo "2" > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable'' (debug mode
where emitted opcodes of the image are printed to the kernel log). An
architecture generic BPF JIT image disassembler can be found in the kernel
source tree under: tools/net/bpf_jit_disasm.c

.SH OPTIONS

.SS -i <source-file/->, --input <source-file/->
Read BPF assembly instruction from an input file or from stdin.

.SS -f <format>, --format <format>
Specify a different output format than the default that is netsniff-ng
compatible. The <format> specifier can be: C, netsniff-ng, xt_bpf, tcpdump.

.SS -b, --bypass
Bypass basic filter validation when emitting opcodes. This can be useful
for explicitly creating malformed BPF expressions that should be injected
into the kernel, e.g. for bug testing.

.SS -V, --verbose
Be more verbose and display some bpfc debugging information.

.SS -d, --dump
Dump all supported instructions to stdout.

.SS -v, --version
Show versioning information.

.SS -h, --help
Show user help.

.SH SYNTAX

The BPF architecture resp. register machine consists of the following
elements:

    Element          Description

    A                32 bit wide accumulator
    X                32 bit wide X register
    M[]              16 x 32 bit wide misc registers aka ``scratch
memory store'', addressable from 0 to 15

A program, that is translated by bpfc into ``opcodes'' is an array that
consists of the following elements:

    o:16, jt:8, jf:8, k:32

The element o is a 16 bit wide opcode that has a particular instruction
encoded, jt and jf are two 8 bit wide jump targets, one for condition
``true'', one for condition ``false''. Last but not least the 32 bit wide
element k contains a miscellaneous argument that can be interpreted in
different ways depending on the given instruction resp. opcode.

The instruction set consists of load, store, branch, alu, miscellaneous
and return instructions that are also represented in bpfc syntax. This
table also includes own bpfc extensions. All operations are based on
unsigned data structures:

.SH SOURCE EXAMPLES

In this section, we give a couple of examples for bpfc source-files, in other
words, some small example filter programs:

.SS Only return packet headers (truncate packets):

  ld poff
  ret a

.SS Only allow ARP packets:

  ldh [12]
  jne #0x806, drop
  ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SS Only allow IPv4 TCP packets:

  ldh [12]
  jne #0x800, drop
  ldb [23]
  jneq #6, drop
  ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SS Only allow IPv4 TCP, SSH traffic:

  ldh [12]
  jne #0x800, drop
  ldb [23]
  jneq #6, drop
  ldh [20]
  jset #0x1fff, drop
  ldxb 4 * ([14] & 0xf)
  ldh [x + 14]
  jeq #0x16, pass
  ldh [x + 16]
  jne #0x16, drop
  pass: ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SS Allow any (hardware accelerated) VLAN:

  ld vlanp
  jeq #0, drop
  ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SS Only allow traffic for (hardware accelerated) VLAN 10:

  ld vlant
  jneq #10, drop
  ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SS More pedantic check for the above VLAN example:

  ld vlanp
  jeq #0, drop
  ld vlant
  jneq #10, drop
  ret #-1
  drop: ret #0

.SH USAGE EXAMPLE

.SS bpfc fubar
Compile the source file ``fubar'' into BPF opcodes. Opcodes will be
directed to stdout.

.SS bpfc -f xt_bpf -b -i fubar, resp. iptables -A INPUT -m bpf --bytecode "`bpfc -f xt_bpf -i fubar`" -j LOG
Compile the source file ``fubar'' into BPF opcodes, bypass basic filter
validation and emit opcodes in netfilter's xt_bpf readable format.

.SS bpfc -
Read bpfc instruction from stdin and emit opcodes to stdout.

.SS bpfc foo > bar, resp. netsniff-ng -f bar ...
Compile filter instructions from file foo and redirect bpfc's output into
the file bar, that can then be read by netsniff-ng(8) through option -f.

.SS bpfc -f tcpdump -i fubar
Output opcodes from source file fubar in the same behaviour as ``tcpdump -ddd''.
